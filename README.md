# Investigating-Fandango-Ratings

In this project, we'll analyze recent movie ratings data to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after [Hickey's analysis](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/). Walt Hickey's investigation suggests that Fandango's rating system was biased and dishonest due to inflated ratings: the actual movie rating was almost always rounded up to the nearest half star displayed on Fandango's web page.
